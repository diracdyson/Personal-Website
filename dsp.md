-  Found significant business discoveries during basic data exploration such as stores in Texas having negative profit in 2017 due to mainly selling large amounts of discounted binders at a loss
- Forecasted for monthly furniture sales under the SARIMAX Box-Jenkins methodology and also used Facebook's Prophet forecasting model
- Analyzed feature importance with MDI and permutation through classifying with RandomForest a K-Means clustering and found furniture as notably and unsurprisingly the most important feature
