Below are some of the topics I have covered relating to machine learning and financial engineering(Sorry currently under heavy construction)
# Statistical and Applied Machine Learning for Data Science
- Semi/Unsupervised learning K-Means, LOF, DBSCAN, GMM, Transformers, AutoEncoders, VAE's
- Supervised learning for forecasting and classification ANN, CNN, LSTM, GDA
- Ensemble methods CART, Random Forest, AdaBoost
- Dimension reduction methods PCA, and LDA
- Feature engineering and Data Analysis preprocessing with SQL, Pandas and Google Data Studio
- Matrix Profile
# Financial Engineering
- Time-Series forecasting Box Jenkins SARIMAX methodology, AR-GARCH vol forecasting with rolling window validation
- Stochastic Calculus volatility modeling
- Numerical methods for simulating PDE's finite diff. method
- Value At Risk, CVaR in classical finance/stats and copulas
- Machine learning copulas
- Kalman Filter
# More specific topics of interest
- Outlier detection in unsupervised learning( writing a paper on this)
- LM, Wald, LR hypothesis test methods( making your own Hypothesis test)
