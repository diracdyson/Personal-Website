[What I work on the daily](/calendar.md)



About me:
- Recent graduate from Stony Brook University with a double major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics and Physics(May 2021)
- Seeking employment as a Quantitative Researcher/ Risk Analyst or Data Scientist/ Analyst
- I have completed various projects in Quantum Computing, Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance either through university, the Institute of Advanced Computational Science at Stony Brook University or independently. My strong suit lies in pure data science, which is more or less data analysis and statistical model development(classical stats, advanced ML, time-series) to solve financial business problems, although you can see I am a researcher at heart.
- What I am good at solving: Industry problems Forecasting(CCAR banking, sales, risk), Classification(fraud, loan pred), Clustering(Customer seg, forecasting, anomaly detection) and all the nauances entailed which require continuous learning
- Besides my more practical mainstream model dev 'industrial' projects I still work on more theoretical statistics/ ML research topics, but more recently I have been trying to apply these more theoretical research ideas in practice effectively, which is rare but not unheard of and more often embraced in financial engineering and typically frowned upon in data science to use models from 'cutting edge' research papers. 
- I am currently working on a research paper on anomaly detection on comparing classical stats(Tukey's fences) and modern day ML methods( VAE's, AE's, density methods, non-parametric methods) and providing a dynamic sophisticated methodological framework for anomaly detection in univariate time-series( potentially generalizes to n-dimensional time-series)

Below are some of the topics I have covered relating to machine learning and financial engineering(Sorry currently under heavy construction)
# Statistical and Applied Machine Learning for Data Science
- Semi/Unsupervised learning K-Means, LOF, DBSCAN, GMM, Transformers, AutoEncoders, VAE's
- Supervised learning for forecasting and classification ANN, CNN, LSTM, GDA
- Ensemble methods CART, Random Forest, AdaBoost
- Dimension reduction methods PCA, and LDA
- Feature engineering and Data Analysis preprocessing with SQL, Pandas and Google Data Studio
- Matrix Profile
# Financial Engineering
- Time-Series forecasting Box Jenkins SARIMAX methodology, AR-GARCH vol forecasting with rolling window validation
- Stochastic Calculus volatility modeling
- Numerical methods for simulating PDE's finite diff. method
- Value At Risk, CVaR in classical finance/stats and copulas
- Machine learning copulas
- Kalman Filter
# More specific topics of interest
- Outlier detection in unsupervised learning( writing a paper on this)
- LM, Wald, LR hypothesis test methods( making your own Hypothesis test)
