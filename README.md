Welcome! This my Data Science/ Financial Engineering portfolio

# [Exploratory Data Anaysis + Sales Time-Series Forecasting and Classifying a Clustering](https://github.com/diracdyson/Super-Store-EDA)
![](/box.png)

-  Found significant business discoveries during basic data exploration such as stores in Texas having negative profit in 2017 due to mainly selling large amounts of discounted binders at a loss
- Forecasted for monthly sales under the SARIMAX Box-Jenkins methodology and also used Facebook's Prophet forecasting model with Logistic
- Analyzed feature importance through classifying a clustering and found furniture as notably and unsurprisingly the most important feature

# [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://github.com/diracdyson/VaRGARCH)
![](/Unknown-2.png)
- There are many ways to calulcate VaR such as historical bootstrapping, the classical Marokwitz way and advanced statistical methods
- In this project Classical Markowtiz theory is compared with time-series parametric methods GARCH developed from scratch and GARCH from the ARCH package with student - t dist.
- Value at Risk is computed three different ways using bootstrapping, Markowitz way and via GARCH

# [Heston Option Pricing](https://www.github.com/diracdyson/HESTON)

- The notrious Black Scholes models assummes Geometric Brownian Motion for the Stock Price; constructing a risk neutral portforlio then subbing in Ito's lemma allows one to derive a beta neutral pricing formula for a call or put
- This leads one to consider how to deal with the 'volatility smile' and time dynamic volatility of not considered in the Black Scholes model
- In this project I conisder Geometric Brownian Motion for the volatility of the stock price, which in turns derives the Heston PDE, I then fit the solution to the PDE to real world option data and extrapolate projections


These are some of the topics I have covered relating to machine learning and financial engineering(Sorry currently under heavy construction)

- Semi/Unsupervised learning K-Means, LOF, DBSCAN, GMM, Transformers, AutoEncoders, VAE's
- Supervised learning for forecasting and classification ANN, CNN, LSTM, GDA
- Ensemble methods CART, Random Forest, AdaBoost
- Dimension reduction methods PCA, and LDA
- Feature engineering and Data Analysis preprocessing with SQL, Pandas and Google Data Studio
# Financial Engineering
