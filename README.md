- In the notrious Black Scholes models assuming Geometric Brownian Motion for the Stock Price and constructing a risk neutral portforlio via Ito's lemma allows one to derive a beta neutral pricing formula
- This leads one to consider how to deal with the 'volatility smile' of the Black Scholes model
- In this project I conisder Geometric Brownian Motion for the volatility of the stock price, which in turns derives the Heston PDE
- I then fit the solution to the PDE to real world option data and extrapolate projections
- Theoretically this project was fascinating but as a practitonar it has major draw backs in that the market prices calibrated from Black Scholes are more accruate
